To test that installed HFST functionalities work as they should, run one 
or more of the tests below:

  ./check-tools.sh             # Command line tools
  ./check-morphologies.sh      # Morphology scripts
  ./check-ospell.sh            # hfst-ospell tool

The tool check-tools.sh accepts the option '--prefix PREFIX' which tells
where the HFST tools to be tested are found. 

The tool check-morphologies.sh accepts the option '--script-prefix PREFIX'
which tells where the morphology scripts can be found and the option
'--hfst-tool-prefix PREFIX' which tells where the hfst tools (hfst-proc,
hfst-optimized-lookup) used in the morphology scripts can be found.

The tool check-ospell.sh accepts the option '--prefix PREFIX' which tells
where hfst-ospell tool is found.

NOTE: python tests can be performed in the source directory of hfst, i.e.
by running python/test/test.sh without any command line arguments.
